## Finding Inspiration

Youtube. Search, "How to build a pen plotter". Found a couple videos:

- https://youtu.be/CW3tCkms7oM?si=zcMRKgs8F6E5Ye7R

Then I found a corresponding instructable:

## Gathering Materials

Thankfully, the instructable had a Bill of Materials: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1K6GGZx7ZxFlsE_SG4vm4hw3O7Y4HbJr1x2MOWS65IPo/edit?usp=sharing.

Since it was my first time, I had no clue why we needed all these parts. I compiled a shopping list, keeping some nuts and bolts as extras. 

With the help of lab staff, I gathered:

**Mechanical Parts**:
+ GT2 Timing Belt
+ GT2 Pulleys (20 teeth 5mm bore)
+ GT2 Idlers (5mm bore)
+ Wheel kits

**Electrical Parts**:
+ Arduino Cable

**Nuts & Washers**:
+ M3, M4, M5 Hex nuts
+ M5 sliding nuts
+ 5x8 mm washers

Then I went down to Chawri Bazaar to get what I needed. It was really tought to source loose pieces of things I needed in this wholesale market. It wasn't difficult to find people who had things, it was simply impossible to buy 100-500 qty. packs of each item.

However I found one shop which allowed me to get bolts if I bought at least 10 of each. From here I got:

**Bolts:**
+ M3 12mm, 16mm
+ M4 12mm, 16mm
+ M5 12mm, 16mm, 20mm, 45mm

**Nuts:**
+ M5 Nyloc Nuts 

Tried very hard to find Aluminium V-slot extrusions (2020, 2040). All the shops near Ajmeri Gate and Paharganj were again wholesalers, so they needed you to buy at least 15ft of any item.

So I ordered these from amazon:
+ 2020, 2040 V slot extrusions (500 mm)
+ M4 Sliding Nuts

Later, I visited Lajpat Rai Market to source electronics. As per lab staff's recommendation, Bonus Electronics had everything I needed at quite a reasonable price! From here I got:

+ Arduino Uno R3
+ CNC Shield V3
+ Short-circuit jumpers for the shield
+ NEMA 17 4.2 kg-cm Stepper Motors
+ DRV 8825 Stepper Drivers
+ 12V 2A DC Adapter

Make sure you also buy an Arduino cable (USB A to B) if you don't have one!

## Substituting materials

The instructable used button head bolts, but I had bought allen head (hex) bolts. Upon reviewing the build process, I realised this didn't matter.

For the POM wheels, I'd need low-profile bolts. These have heads that don't jut out of the surface of the hole they're in, allowing you to put whatever on top. I later realised these would come with any POM wheel _kit_ that I bought!

I couldn't find rubber feet (used for anti-vibration) for the frame, so I hope to 3D print the frame's feet using ABS. This was inspired by: https://youtu.be/wbEcyv422MU

# Assembly

Okay, so now since we have all the materials we need:

+ For the frame:

+ Mechanical Parts:

+ Electronics:

+ Nuts, Bolts:

# Wiring & Electricals

## Arduino + Shield + Drivers

- Setting up the drivers

WARNING:

## Making Appropriate Connectors

- Crimping the NEMA connectors

- Separating + and - from the DC adapter's barrel plug


# Adding the code

Thanks for reading. Hope this inspires you to build smth on ur own!
